# Problem
You want to read a shapefile.

# Solution
The ``rgdal`` package has the function ``readOGR()`` to read shapefiles:

```r
> library(rgdal)
> cities <- readOGR('../../Data', 'cities')
```

```
OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
Source: "../../Data", layer: "cities"
with 606 features and 4 fields
Feature type: wkbPoint with 2 dimensions
```
The ``maptools`` package also has functions to read shapefiles:

```r
> library(maptools)
> cities <- readShapeSpatial('../../Data/cities')
```
The ``PBSmapping`` package, which requires the ```maptools``, ``sp``, ``rgeos`` and ``foreign`` packages, also has functions to read shapefiles:

```r
> library(PBSmapping);
```

```
Error: there is no package called 'PBSmapping'
```

```r
> library(maptools);
> library(sp);
> library(rgeos);
```

```
Error: there is no package called 'rgeos'
```

```r
> library(foreign);
> cities <- importShapefile('../../Data/cities', readDBF=FALSE);
```

```
Error: could not find function "importShapefile"
```


# Discussion
The Esri [shapefile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile), or simply a shapefile, is a popular geospatial vector data format for storing geometric location and associated attribute information. A shapefile is a set of files. Three individual files are mandatory to store the core data that comprise a shapefile: .shp, .shx, and .dbf. There are further optional files which store primarily index data to improve performance. All files should be located in the same folder.  

When using ``readOGR()`` to read ``cities.shp`` located at ``~/Data (windows: C:/Data)``, define the ``dsn`` argument as the path and the ``layer`` argument as the name of the file without extension. For example: ``readOGR('~/Data', "cities")``. If the shapefile is in the current working directory, an equivalent function call is: ``readOGR('.', "cities")``. See ``?readOGR`` for a detailed description of available arguments.  

With ``readShapeSpatial()``, use ``readShapeSpatial('~/Data/cities')`` to read ``cities.shp`` located at ``~/Data (windows: C:/Data)``. If the shapefile is in the current working directory, an equivalent function call is: ``readShapeSpatial('cities')``. The maptools package also has specific functions for each vector data type: ``readShapePoints()``, ``readShapePoly()`` and ``readShapeLines()``. ``readShapeSpatial()`` can be used instead of the previous three functions. See ``?readShapeSpatial`` for a detailed description of available arguments.
